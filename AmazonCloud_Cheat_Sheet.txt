## The cheatsheet describes how to use Amazon Cloud
1. Create a key pair. Download it to your computer, you need this to log in. Make it executable.
		chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
2. Create an instance and log into it. 
3. Create a volume and attach the volume to the instance.
## list the block devices on the instance
      		lsblk
## list the file system type on the volume, and determine whether to create one 
		sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
## If there's no file systems, create an ext4 file system on the volume
		sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
## create a mount point for the volume
		mkdir ~/data
## mount the volume to the location
		mount /dev/xvdf /home/ubuntu/data
## upload all sequence data to the volume
sudo scp -i rong-umd.pem /media/megan/Elements2/Hsub_RawSeq_Data/MP/2KB_R1.fastq ec2-user@public_dns_name:~/data

4. Run processes (alignments, etc.) and save output to the volume. 
5. Unmount the volume.
		umount -d /dev/xvdf
## download data to the local computer
sudo scp -i rong-umd.pem ec2-user@public_dns_name:~/data/ResultDownload /media/megan/Elements2/Hsub_RawSeq_Data/MP/
6. Terminate instance when processes finish running. Output should be saved to the volume so when a new instance is started you can mount that volume and all data is there, and taking image stores the programs in an AMI. 
7. If you resize the volume run: 
	resize2fs /dev/xvdf
## You need to first change the volume size in AWS website. Select "Modify Volume" and "Size".
