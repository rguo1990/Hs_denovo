## The scripts were used in validation of a reference-assisted assembly approach using existing and novel Heliothine genomes, including a novel C.subflexa short-read assembly, a C.virescens Dovetail assembly, as well as the other two published Helicoverpa assemblies.
## A novel Chloridea subflexa (previously Heliothis subflexa) short-read assembly was generated, and it was used in the validation.
## Scripts used for: Guo, Rong, Alexie Papanicolaou, and Megan L. Fritz. "Validation of reference-assisted assembly using existing and novel Heliothine genomes." Genomics 114.5 (2022): 110441.
